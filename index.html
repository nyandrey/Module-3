        <p>In the 19th century, they called it “colored hearing”—letters and words, when spoken, took on mental weight and shimmered with color in the mind’s eye. For Miss C., who was interviewed in 1892, “n” was nut-brown, “w” a pinkish heliotrope, and her own initial, “c” a vivid lemon yellow, “the brightest color of all.” Miss C. had no explanation for her peculiarity. In fact, until she was approached by the students of Wellesley College psychology professor Mary Calkins, she hadn’t even thought of it as a peculiarity. She just assumed everybody saw letters in color. There was a theory at the time that colored hearing might be the result of associations learned in childhood. Maybe Miss C. had once played with wooden blocks that had a bright yellow “C” painted on them. But the summary of her case, published in an 1893 paper in The American Journal of Psychology, dismissed this idea; not all the colors Miss C. heard lined up with toy blocks.In 2012, Nathan Witthoft, then a Ph.D. student in psychology at MIT, put group of synesthetes through a series of color-matching tests. During the course of the study, he noticed something odd.  “For this one person, every sixth letter was the same color,” he said. “When I asked them why, they said they had learned it from this toy”—specifically, from the plastic letters included in Fisher-Price’s School Days Desk playset.Today, those plastic letters are at the center of a scientific debate over what synesthesia is and how it begins. For more than a century scientists have been asking how synesthetes’ brains make connections between colors and letters. Now, it turns out that question could have implications for everyone—how we learn and how we remember.The School Days Desk came out in 1972. It was one of the first projects toy designer Victor Reiling worked on for Fisher-Price. Just a couple years before, Reiling had been the captain of a Navy ship stationed off the coast of Vietnam.
